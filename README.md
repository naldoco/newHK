# newHK
* To start a new Haskell kata ready to BDD/TDD in few seconds using *stack*.
* The kata will be placed next to the other katas in its own directory.
  * Easy to configurate in which subdir by editing the bash program in only one place.

## Usage:
    newHK  NameOfTheNewHaskellKata

## Details:
* Based on this way of programming:
  * https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/bdd-in-haskell-with-hspec/
    * I only put the recipe into a bash file.

## Features:
* Automatically update uppercase/lowercase of the name of the kata wherever is needed.
* Check after smashing an existent directory.
* Without arguments, it shows some help.
